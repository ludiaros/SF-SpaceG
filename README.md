# SF.Space.Game
A game (prototype) about evading objects in the space

This is my first attempt to create a complete game using SFML, actually it's only a prototype on which i implement what i've learned about SFML

TODO:
- Make it consistent with framerate changes
- Build a GUI for it
- Implement a score system
- Implement saves maybe?
